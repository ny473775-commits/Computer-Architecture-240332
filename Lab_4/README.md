# Lab 4: VHDL Code for Combinational Circuits (MUX and DEMUX)

## Objective
• To design and simulate a 4-to-1 Multiplexer (MUX) in VHDL.
• To design and simulate a 1-to-4 Demultiplexer (DEMUX) in VHDL.
## Theory
### Multiplexer (MUX)
A multiplexer selects one of 2n
input data lines and routes it to a single output based on n
select lines. A 4-to-1 MUX has 4 data inputs (D0–D3), 2 select lines (S1S0), and 1 output
(Y).

### S1 S0 Y
### 0 0 D0
### 0 1 D1
### 1 0 D2
### 1 1 D3

## Demultiplexer (DEMUX)
A demultiplexer routes a single input to one of 2n output lines based on n select lines. A 1-to-4
DEMUX has 1 data input (D), 2 select lines (S1S0), and 4 outputs (Y0–Y3).

### S1 S0 Active Output
### 0 0 Y0 = D
### 0 1 Y1 = D
### 1 0 Y2 = D
### 1 1 Y3 = D

## Output

## Discussion and conclusion
From this lab, we understand how a 4to1 MUX works using 2 select lines and how 2 lines are used to uniquely identify 4 different lines and send one output based on the input
###
We also see how a 1to4 DEMUX works exactly the opposite in which, again, 2 lines were used to identify 4 lines and depending upon the selection line one of the 4 lines is high.
