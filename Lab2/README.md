# Lab 2: VHDL Code for Realizing Logic Gates

# Objective: 
• To write VHDL code for basic logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR. • To simulate each gate and verify its truth table using GTKWave.

# Theory:
Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of all digital circuits. Each gate performs a basic Boolean operation on one or more binary inputs to produce a single binary output.

# Gate VHDL Operator Boolean Expression: 
 1) AND and Y = A · B
 2) OR or Y = A + B
 3) NOT not Y = bar(A)
 4) NAND nand Y = bar(A · B)
 5) NOR nor Y = bar(A + B)
 6) XOR xor Y = bar(A ⊕ B)
 7) XNOR xnor Y = bar(A ⊕ B)

Therefore, from the output waveform in gtkwave we can see the expected result for all logic gates in the form of signals. The waveforms are displayed for first 10ns as a = b = 0, the next 10ns i.e till 20ns, a = 1, b = 0, the next 30ns i.e. till 30ns a = 0, b = 1, and finally a = b = 1, the result of the logic gates is given below a and b.
